# AI-based-IDS

This project is part of my final thesis, where I developed an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques on the NSL-KDD dataset. The system is implemented in Python, utilizing algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Trees to detect network intrusions by analyzing network traffic data.
